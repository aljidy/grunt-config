//Mixins

//Vars -- Simple as in $red not $red-color

//Resets

//Helpers -- Genric as hell (if allowed) eg. .left{float:left}

//Main -- One return for related so between .header & .header nav and none for things like &:hover -- ids only used for js and have the prefix eg. #js-header -- spaces in classes are dashes
